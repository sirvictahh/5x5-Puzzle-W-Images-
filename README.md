5x5 Taj Mahal Puzzle with images in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The "Puzzle" application is intended to manipulate a puzzle of 5x5 pieces that constitute a photo of the Indian monument of the "Taj Mahal"; the images that constitute the pieces are in the "Imag02" folder, which is part of the folder structure provided by the teacher; the application has three functional states, described by the respective title and established by each of the respective buttons:

a) "Normal Game" state, - It should be the initial state, identified by the title "Puzzle - Taj Mahal - In Normal Game" and accessed by the button "shuffle and play"; in this state, the puzzle was shuffled and put into play with the "end" piece removed from view and constituting the "hole" of the puzzle, to where the contiguous piece that is clicked will be placed; after each click, it should be checked if the puzzle was finished and if so, it should move to the "Finished" state;

b) "Facilitated Play" state, - Is identified by the title "Puzzle - Taj Mahal - In Facilitated Play" and is accessed by the "facilitate and play" button; this game state is functionally identical to the "Normal Game" state, but instead of being shuffled it is started in an order that allows it to move to the "Finished" state by successive clicks on pieces "18", "19", "20", "15", "10", "5", "4", "3", "2", "1", "6", "11", "16", "21", "22", "23", and "24";

c) "Finished" State, - Should be the initial state, it is identified by the title "Puzzle - Taj Mahal - Finished" and is accessed by the "finish" button; in this state, the puzzle is complete and locked to the game, with all the pieces visible;

Make sure that both "puzzle.html" and the images folder are on the same workspace.
